Alan, without actually trying to dive too deep into this, my main question is:

Who should actually be targeted by these "open source in education" initiatives?

Politicians live in a world with many motivations, both natural and aritificial.  They allocate the money, but it is usually those closer to the ground that make the actual deployment decisions.Â  Its unlikely that an effort as grandiosely described as the "Digital Education Revolution" is going to decide to go open source, if only because of the big money interests that corrupt most political processes.

However, I do believe we have a chance to convince those doing the teaching (and administering).  The natural philosophy of education encourages investigation, understanding, learning.Â  "Openness" is a natural for educators.Â  Not so much for politicians.

Yes I'm cynical.
