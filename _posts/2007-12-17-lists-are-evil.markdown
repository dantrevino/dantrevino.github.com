All of those web2.0 organizing sites are great, but.....  Lists are evil.

todoist.com, basecamphq, rememberthemilk.com, etc, etc.  Good people, great sites.  But they all address the problem of getting organized in a fundamentally wrong way.

Lists are evil.

I've read the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a>, the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/04/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/">ZTD</a>, <a href="http://www.franklincovey.com/">franklin covey</a> systems.  I use pieces of each of them.  And in fairness, they dont claim to be a cureall.  Hell, ZTD is more of a guide for implementing some pieces of GTD in a more realistic manner, rather than a pure organizational system.

In my experience, though, the only way to really get things done is to put it on your calendar.  Dont list it.  Schedule it.  Now.  If you have to move a scheduled item for whatever reason, thats ok.  re-Schedule it.

<strong>The calendar is the only tool you need to really get organized. </strong> 

Need to paybills before the end of the month? Schedule it.  Need to buy a christmas gift?  Schedule it.  Need more information before you can schedule a task?  Put that on your schedule.

Just dont forget to carry your schedule with you.  It doesnt matter if you use paper, post-it notes, your cell phone, or whatever.  Just keep your schedule and you'll get more done.
