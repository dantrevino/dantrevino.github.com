<p class="line862">The FloridaTeam participated in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Linux">Tampa Linux meetup</a> held Jan 10th at J. Christophers. While not strictly an Ubuntu event, we nevertheless had a strong showing. Stickers and CDs were given away, and they were able to pick up several new team members. The best part was the afterparty, where <a href="https://launchpad.net/~thelupine ">Lupine</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~itnet7">itnet7</a> sat down with several of us for a mini bug jam/5-a-day howto in preparation for the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam">GlobalBugJam</a>.</p>
