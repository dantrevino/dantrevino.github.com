The day trip to Poas and La Paz went ok, but had all the annoyances associated with a tour group. We weren't given enough time to explore anything but the main trails around either area. Also, going to Poas during the rainy season seems to be hit or miss in terms of what you'll be able to see.

We arrived early, and were lucky enough to have just enough sun to burn off some of the fog so that we could see the crater. But it didnt last. On the other hand, trying to drive there myself might have been a challenge. The rain forest lived up to its name. My camera and I both got too wet, but it was a nice experience. A little too 'tourist' for me, but nice.
