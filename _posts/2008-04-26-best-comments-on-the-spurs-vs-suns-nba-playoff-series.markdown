Being a <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs">Spur</a>'s fan, I read <a href="http://www.poundingtherock.com">Pounding The Rock</a> periodically.  Two recent comments jumped out at me.  The <a href="http://www.poundingtherock.com/2008/4/20/421176/story-title">first</a>, by <a href="http://www.poundingtherock.com/users/Matthew%20Powell">Matthew Powell</a>:
<blockquote>How bad were you Shaq?  Allow me to illustrate.  (That means I'm going to paint a picture, but with words.  (Words are those small black things that confuse you.))

Let's say the Spurs could reincarnate the 1979-80 version of George Gervin.  Furthermore, let's say he was being guarded by a paraplegic.  Who'd fallen out of her wheelchair.  And was unconscious.  I would still want Gervin to pass the ball to Tony or Manu so they could run pick and roll with Duncan.  That's how fucking horrible you are.  Are you just lazy?  Do you have really bad corns that limit your mobility?  Do you think the Spurs would eventually miss a layup?

Do you think if you talk enough people will gloss over the fact that Tim Duncan, the guy you were brought to stop, just dropped 40 on your fat ass?  16-24.  And that three.  Ouch.  But hey that's not your fault.  You were busy standing at the free throw line where you were intently guarding, uhh, the free throw line.  You had that shit locked down, bro.  Oh, and you had 5 rebounds.  To be fair, they were whole rebounds.  No half rebounds in there.  Of course when you on the court the Spurs shot 97%, so there weren't many boards to be had.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shaq is such a bitch. I hate him. HATE. If I was in a room with him, Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden and had a gun with two bullets, I'd shoot Shaq twice to make sure he was dead.

Is that too much?</blockquote>
