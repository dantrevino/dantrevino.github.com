We had a great team meeting tonight.  We had a few new people show up, and a few older members as well.

Lots going on these days around <a href="http://www.ubuntu-fl.org/">Ubuntu Florida</a>.   Several of us will be attending the newly started <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Linux/">Tampa Linux &amp; OSS Meetup</a> this Saturday, the 10th.  As a team, we're gearing up to have a face-to-face meetup in Miami around the <a href="http://barcamp.org/barcampmiami">BarCamp Miami</a> and <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/miami">FOWA</a> timeframe, and then two weeks after that, we have the <a href="http://www.floridalinuxshow.com/">Florida Linux Show</a> in Jacksonville.   Last years show was a great success so I'm really shooting to go big this year.
