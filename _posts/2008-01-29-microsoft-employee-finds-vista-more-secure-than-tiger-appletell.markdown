title: Vista is Most Secure OS... not
excerpt: So its time to crank out the semi-annual "Windows is more secure..." argument.  I'm sorry, but YOU LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY WHEN YOUR OS CAN BE COMPROMISED BY A VULNERABILITY IN YOUR MEDIA PLAYER!

So out comes the semi-annual "Windows is more secure..." argument.  Are they joking?  YOU LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY WHEN YOUR OS CAN BE COMPROMISED BY A VULNERABILITY IN YOUR MEDIA PLAYER!

or how about this:

We've heard this before.    Ie is more secure than firefox.  XP is more secure than Linux.  Usually its a cowardly marketing tool purchased from an "independent" third party.  This time they at least had the balls to say it themselves.  Give 'em credit for that.   

But as I  said.  You dont get talk about your security being better than anybody until you  can create an os that cant be compromised by an mp3 player or instant messenger.
