Ubuntu Open Week and Ubuntu Developer Week are great resources for the community and those who wish to become more active.Â  Now I live in IRC for most of the day, but IRC as a venue is not the most conducive to active learning.

There is an Ubuntu Developer Channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ubuntudevelopers">on YouTube</a>, and its quite useful.Â  I think this idea should be extended to Open Week and Developer Week.
