UDS Jaunty keeps getting better.  Christophe from the <a href="http://www.ubuntu-fr.org" target="_blank">French LoCo</a> clued us in to his <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/1759" target="_blank">4000+ participant Intrepid Release Party</a>, and pointed us to his team's website code, which we're using as a basis for our next gen web site.

Stephane Graber and I are working with upstream OpenVZ to make sure that it is available in Jaunty Universe.Â  Hopefully everyone can marshall the resources to get there.
