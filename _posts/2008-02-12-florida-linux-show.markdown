The Ubuntu Florida LoCo team took part in the just completed Florida Linux Show.  It was a great time.  We had a Face-to-Face social meetup on Sunday night before the show, and later that night hooked up with Josh, Eric, and Joel from the Georgia LoCo team.  <br />
<br />
After a few beers and some insights into the challenges of osx and vista, we declared the first, semi-unofficial, Georgia-Florida Dual LoCo Meetup a huge success.<br />
<br />
8am Monday is tough after a night out with the with the Georgia and Florida guys, but we made it in, laid out the swag, and immediately saw a steady stream of visitors to the booth.  We signed up some new members, helped out some people with installs, learned  some things, and  generally had a really great time.  Thanks to Josh from the Georgia team for the CDs and case badges.  Thanks to Canonical for the conference pack.  Thanks to Rod for putting on a great show.  Most of all, thanks to the Florida LoCo team, who had a great turnout at the booth and great support from those who couldn't show.  <br />
<br />
Dinner/beers with John "Maddog" Hall, the OpenVZ guys, and the organizers capped a great weekend.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to next year.
