Wow.  If this is a legitimate offer, its a huge step in the right direction.  They still need to work on making true patent-free open standards, but I'll take this.

edit: After taking a deeper look, I'm having some doubts.  There are real questions that need to be answered by Microsoft if they want to prove they are for real.  Otherwise its just another marketing event. RedHat has their take on the whole thing <a href="http://www.press.redhat.com/2008/02/21/red-hat-statement-on-microsoft-announcement/">here</a>.
