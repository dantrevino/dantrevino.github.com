They call us the <a href="http://ubuntu-fl.org">Ubuntu <strong>Florida</strong> Local Community</a> team, and we are.  But we're driven by the local activists that make up our team all over the state.

As many have heard by now, we are looking at <a href="http://www.ubuntu-fl.org/index.php/news/1-ubuntu/138-jaunty-release-parties.html">6 or 7 release parties here in Florida</a>.  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Gainesville">Gainesville</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Orlando">Orlando</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Melbourne/Rockledge">Melbourne</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Tampa">Tampa</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Jacksonville">St. Augustine/Jacksonville</a>, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Miami">Miami</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FloridaTeam/Projects/JauntyReleaseParties#Tallahassee">Tallahassee</a>.  This is really a tribute to the efforts of the people getting involved at the local level.  <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ecrashsystems">Douglass</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Epak33m">Jimmy</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eitnet7">Chris</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ejpugh">John</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Eneotaoisttechnopagan">Jon</a>, <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Eraphsabb">Raphael</a>, and <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Emaxolasersquad">David</a> are all great examples of the enthusiasm, not just for Ubuntu, but for GNU, Linux, and Open Standards, that exist here in Florida.

While its true we wont reach the shear numbers generated by the <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/node/1759">some other groups</a>, and not every party we have is going to have 40-50 people attending, our goal is to be able to hit every corner of Florida with at least 1 launch event.

I think we can do this everywhere.  And we should.

There is no reason that someone in Lincoln, Billings, Lubbock, or Shreveport cant print out some fliers and go stand in front of a Library.  Or that folks in Camas, Louisville, Trenton, or Anchorage can burn some CDs and hand them out at schools.

You get my point.  Release parties can happen everywhere.  It doesn't have to be pizza and beer with 50, 20, or even 10 people.  If there is no release party in your area, make one!  A single person answering questions and getting the word out is still a huge success.

In the words of <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Easommer">asommer</a>: Party On!
