Ubuntu podcast #17 is out.Â  <a href="http://ubuntupodcast.net">Watch Josh &amp; Nick get jiggy wit' it</a>.

Seriously, if you havent sat down to watch one of their podcasts, they're usually informative and alway entertaining.Â  And this Sunday (1/18) they'll be interviewing Jorge Castro, Canonical's External Developer Relations guru.Â  Should be good stuff!
