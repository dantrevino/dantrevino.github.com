  1. Everyone's got an opinion on the Stoudemire/Diaw suspension.
  
  As a Spurs fan, I think the suspension is the worst thing that could have happened.  Now, when the Spurs beat the Suns, all of the talk will center around the 1 game that Stoudemire/Diaw missed.  And all the idiots will come out and lamblast the NBA and the Spurs and complain how things could have been different.  They'll conveniently ignore the other 3 games the Spurs won.  Mark my words, it will happen.

1. Everyone's got an opinion on the Stoudemire/Diaw suspension.

As a Spurs fan, I think the suspension is the worst thing that could have happened.  Now, when the Spurs beat the Suns, all of the talk will center around the 1 game that Stoudemire/Diaw missed.  And all the idiots will come out and lamblast the NBA and the Spurs and complain how things could have been different.  They'll conveniently ignore the other 3 games the Spurs won.  Mark my words, it will happen.

2.  Dirty?

I've been a Spurs fan all my life.  I remember all the times they seemingly had the "better" team, yet lost in the first or second round of the playoffs.  They were called soft.  People said they couldn't win big games.  They eventually broke through.  Guys like Robinson and Duncan will do that for a team.  And since they've broken through, the talk (until recently) was always how professional and fundamentally sound they were.

Now one whiner complains and all of a sudden they're a "dirty" team.  No semi-intelligent person will defend Horry's foul as not being cheap.  It was.  

It was also <ul>one</ul> hit. 1. ONE.

I can hear it now....but Bowen is dirty too!  Every player and fan that complains about Bowen would be cheering him on if he was on their team.  To deny it is to be a baldface liar.  Every player has a bag of tricks.  The Spurs are the best perimeter defense team for a reason.  They make opposing players uncomfortable when they shoot.  Other players throughout the years have had their own tricks.  Some bring their knees up whenever they drive the lane.  Some 7+ foot player throw elbows out at shoulder height when they get a rebound, or even when they dont.  Some players aren't basketball players at all, and come straight out to tackle you *cough* fortson *cough*.

The difference between those players and Bowen?  Bowen is on the Spurs and those other players are on your team.  Admit it.  Everyone of those guys endears themselves to the home crowd for their "toughness".  But put them on another team and they're "dirty".  

The same people that love McHale hate Lambier.  Kite, Oakley, Mahorn, Artest.  All loved by homers hated by others.  

Suns fans conveniently forget how Marion "accidently" threw his foot under Dirk Nowitski just a week after Nowitski injured his ankle (and gloriously <a href="http://www.brightsideofthesun.com/story/2007/4/1/182137/0685">noted</a> in a Suns blog) and that Raja Bell <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEG4F84Odtc">isnt exactly a choirboy</a> himself. Buncha hypocrites.

3. Want some cheese with that whine?

Duncan laughed after one of the Suns game when a reporter asked him if this series was physical.  

Denver was definitely much more physical that Phoenix.  And they always have been.  2 years ago, when the Spurs played Denver, they knocked Ginobilli and Parker to the ground on literally every drive toward the basket.  Forget about just when they were shooting.  Every time.  Denver got a couple of technicals.  Ginobilli and Parker got up from the floor and just won games.

You didnt hear the Spurs whining like a bunch of pansies.

3b.  Foul smell

You'll also note that Pop didnt go crying to the media after Phoenix somehow got all of the non-calls and questionable calls in game 4.  On San Antonios' home floor even.  <a href="http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-24-65/Phoenix-Got-the-Calls.html">Outshot at the free throw line something like 30-15</a>.  D'Antoni apparently has track shoes for just such an occasion.  And never fails to use them.
