I just got around to watching Ubuntu Podcast #25 last night.  Outside of the ugly logo on Josh's laptop, it was great!

In addition to the usual fun from Nick and Josh, they had a great interview ith Dustin Kirkland.  Check it out if you haven't.  I learned some things about screen profiles which I hadn't known previously.  Good stuff.
