<div style=''>So surely we all know <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/faq">Digital Restrictions Management is bad</a>, right? Then why do people keep buying into a system that benefits only the key holder?  Microsoft is the latest key holder to steal from its customers.  Yes, all of those people who thought they were buying music forever, are now realizing that they don't own squat.  And just for good measure, Microsoft doesn't care that they're screwing their customers.  Big surprise.  <br /><br />No, microsoft is surely not the first, and wont be the last.  All you people who keep buying encrypted iTunes music will face the same thing one day, but at least you have the option of burning the files to CDs.  Get started early, because burning 30 GB of music to CD is gonna take you a while.<br /><br />http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/04/23/drm_claims_more_victims_as_microsoft_fails_its_music_users.html<br /><br /><br /></div>
