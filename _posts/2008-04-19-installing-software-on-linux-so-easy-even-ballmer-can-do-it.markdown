For those who cant get past the incredibly complex application installation procedures for Ubuntu:
<strong>1. Click on "Applications"</strong>

<strong>2. Click "Add/Remove"</strong>

<strong>3. Check the box next to the application you want</strong>

<strong>
4. Click "Apply"
5. A pop up box will appear asking for your administrator password.  Enter it.
6. A pop up box will appear confirming all of your selections.  Click "Apply"
7. Now here is the hard part, and the part that probably confused some people: Wait for the software to be downloaded and installed automatically.</strong>

8. Click "Close"</strong>

I wont even link to idiot who claimed he cant figure it out because he just writes sensationalistic crap to generate page views.  As a side note, my non-computer-oriented wife just read this and said 'Even I know how to do that.'  Who gives time to these "computer" experts who aren't even as computer savvy as my wife?

edit: added the missing root password request
