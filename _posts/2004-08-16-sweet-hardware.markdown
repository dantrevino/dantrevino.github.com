Got a sweet new Linksys Network Storage Link today. It uses samba to
 share external USB 2.0 disks over your network. I had some initial

issues having it read my Acomdata RocketPod, but a quick download of the newest firmware, and I was on my way.<br /><br />Now....how does it work streaming video.....we'll see...
