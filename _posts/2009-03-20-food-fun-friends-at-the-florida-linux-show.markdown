The Florida Linux Show happened Monday, March 9 in Jacksonville, and the Ubuntu Florida LoCo was out in force!...as usual.

I was recently told that building a community is about 'action, not talk.'  Well, I can honestly say that the Florida LoCo is one of the most action oriented groups I've been involved with.  We participate in events all over the state, and they're always well attended.  Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, or Tampa, it doesnt matter, we always have good turnouts.  Even better, is that we're not just about Ubuntu and Linux.  There is some great friendship and  camaraderie amongst the team members, even outside the LoCo.

Sunday Night:

We got together for dinner at Mellow Mushroom.  It was great to see the cigar-toting <a href="http://www.boredandblogging.com">Nick</a> and <a href="http://linuxcrypt.net">Josh</a> from the <a href="http://ubuntupodcast.net/">Ubuntu Podcast</a> again.  I got to finally meet Michael and Michelle, who are developing <a href="http://www.quinncoincorporated.org/index.php">Qimo</a>.  <a href="http://crashsystems.net/">Crashsystems</a>, DJ Jimmy, Chris and his family, Chuck, Matt, <a href="http://www.evolutionaryit.com/blog/">Joseph</a>, Guare, and of course, the lovely and talented Smita, all joined us.  Good food and good friends!

Monday:

Spent early morning getting the table set up.  Ubuntu Podcast was next to us, Canonical was next to them, and Qimo was across from us, so we had a great Ubuntu presence in the area.  DJ Jimmy laid down <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/nk9rmv">the flow</a>.  Went to watch the keynote by Zonker about community, which was not bad, but was a <a href="http://www.jpugh.org/2009/03/how-not-to-represent-community.html">bit ironic</a>.  We handed out CDs, talk to some people about installation questions, and attended some great sessions. <a href="http://www.ubuntu-fl.org/images/stories/fls_fl-loco_edited.jpg">Nine or ten LoCo members</a> took turns at the booth, dispensing their Ubuntu wisdom.

Monday night, for the after party, we met up at Seven Bridges, a near-by restaurant/micro-brewery, and accomplished absolutely nothing.  Which was great.

A good time was had by all.  If you are interested in getting to  know this crazy cast of characters, please join us at our next gathering on  April 18 at <a href="http://www.barcamporlando.org/">BarCamp Orlando</a> where we will getting our geek on and hopefully doing some Ubuntu/LoCo presentations.
