And so my master plan has begun to come together. This week I purchased

a 1GB SD card for use in my Treo 600. Combined with the excellent <a href="http://www.softick.com/cardexport/">Card Export</a> software from Softick, I now have what amounts to a Phone/Palm/1GB USB storage. Sweet!



Next up, I'm selling my current camera and will purchase one that uses SD.



Finally, someday, I'll purchase myself a nice Linux <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/321957-64295-89315-321838-f33-395654.html">laptop</a> with an SD reader built in.



And now, with the <a href="http://blog.treonauts.com/2004/08/omg_treo_650_ac.html">new bluetooth enabled treo</a> coming soon, my life will finally be complete.
