Pictures are finally available from the Jaunty release parties held across Florida!  We had a great release party cycle this time around.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>April 23</strong></span>: The parties started in the far west of Florida, in Pensacola.  <a href="https://launchpad.net/~maxolasersquad">David</a> made a 3 hour trip out to Pensacola to take some swag and represent the LoCo with the <a href="http://www.pcolalug.org/">Pensacola LUG</a>.  The great thing is, we found out there are several Ubuntu implementations coming up in the area.  We hope to have more news on these real soon!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>April 25</strong></span>: Northeast and north central Florida get their Jaunty shake on!  Two parties on the 25th made for a hectic day for some of us, but we were able to pull both of them off!  In Jacsksonville/St. Augustine, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~neotaoisttechnopagan">Jon</a> threw a nice shindig at <a href="http://www.citycoffeeco.com/">City Coffee</a>.  We were able to help out some new (to Ubuntu) users with installs, and even started the coffee shop owner on a path toward Ubuntu enlightenment.  Later that evening, in Gainesville, we capped off the day with pizza, drinks, a mini-LAN party, and lots of fun.  Thanks to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~crashsystems">Douglass</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/~clinton-collins-family">Clint</a> for organizing, and the  folks at <a href="http://www.fiberopticsplus.com/">Fiber Optics Plus</a>, who have always been supportive of Linux, for allowing us to use their facility again.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 2</strong></span>: Another dual-release-party day!  <a href="https://launchpad.net/~maxolasersquad">David</a> secured a room in the Leroy Collins Public Library in downtown Tallahassee.  Several members of the local LUG joined us to hand out CDs, do a Wubi demo,  and talk Ubuntu.  Later that afternoon, in Tampa, the LoCo team threw down with a combo Release Party/LAN Party.  Michelle, of the <a href="http://www.qimo4kids.com/">Qimo </a>project, helped organize a great party.  About 20 people showed up, ate cupcakes, did some fragging, and generally got their geek on and partied late into the night.  Thanks to "[pnp]thomas" for helping out with the venue and to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~dave-cabot">Dave</a> for trying to work with us on organizing at the last minute.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 3</strong></span>:  The Jaunty party train finally made its way to central Florida on Sunday, May 3.   We met at a local Panera, where some of the newer members of the LoCo team showed up and promptly began discussing functional programming languages.  Well...we considered it a party!!  Once we took a break from arguing programming languages, we handed out some Ubuntu swag, did the Jaunty Jackelope dance, ate, drank, and were merry.  <a href="http://launchpad.net/~pak33m">Jimmy</a> helped organize the Orlando party for the 3rd year in a row, and as usual, did a great job.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May 10</strong></span>: In a bid to stir up some controversy, the Florida team decided to make south Florida show its true Ubuntu spirit by holding the Miami release party on Mother's Day.  The key is, we knew the Moms out there would drag their non-computer-literate husbands out to celebrate the big release on their way to lunch/dinner/celebration.  We were right!  Well ... a little bit right. <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ropetin">Ropetin</a> organized our party at the <a class="http" href="http://www.brewurbancafe.com/">Brew Urban Cafe</a>.  I didnt get to attend, but everyone agreed it was a great location.  Several of the  newer LoCo team members came out, and everyone who attended had a great time.

We have an 8th party organized, but it was delayed until June 6th because we just didnt have enough time to fit everything into the 3 weeks before UDS.

I dont even know where to start congratulating and thanking people.  <a href="http://launchpad.net/~zoopster"></a>

<a href="https://launchpad.net/~jpugh">John</a> really helped out with the swag.  I really can't thank him enough, personally, for his continued support of the Florida <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> Georgia LoCo teams.

<a href="http://www.on-disk.com">On-Disk.com</a> got us kickstarted with some great pre-printed CDs before we even had our 'official' allotment from ShipIt.  Thanks so much to <a href="http://identi.ca/webpath">@webpath</a> and "hal14450" for setting us up with the on-disk.com CDs.  They were really friendly and helpful.  I recommend you check out <a href="http://groups.on-disk.com">groups.on-disk.com</a> to see what community efforts they have ongoing.

Of course <a href="http://launchpad.net/~itnet7">Chris</a>, the individual organizers (<a href="http://launchpad.net/~crashsystems">Douglass</a>, <a href="http://launchpad.net/~neotaoisttechnopagan">Jon</a>, <a href="http://launchpad.net/~maxolasersquad">David</a> (twice!), <a href="http://launchpad.net/~pak33m">Jimmy</a>, <a href="http://launchpad.net/~ropetin">Ropetin</a>, and <a href="http://www.qimo4kids.com/">Michelle</a>), and the entire LoCo team did a great job of getting out, having fun, and spreading the Ubuntu message.
