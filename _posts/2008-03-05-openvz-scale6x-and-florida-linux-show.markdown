Kir talking about his experience at the Florida Linux Show.  I was actually in the audience, sitting behind the Georgia LoCo boys (Josh, Eric, Joel).  They and others around me were very impressed with the talk, especially the live migration demo.  Getting to buy Kir and Andrey a beer was a bonus.

As it stands, OpenVZ will be available in Hardy, but hopefully we'll have a more complete implementation for Intrepid Ibex.
