Well, I proved Rupak wrong today. He'd said that once you're past 30, it doesn't matter until you hit 40. Its been a few years/McDonalds #4 Meals since I'd been hiking regularly. Today Mohan, Puru, and I decided to tackle the 2 mile trek to the <a href="http://www.nwhiker.com/CGNSAHike09.html">Wahkeena Springs</a>. Then on to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=devils+rest">Devil's Res</a>t trail. About 1600 ft elevation. Ow. I still hurt. A few years back this woulda been easy. I need to get back in shape.
It was worth the pain though. And it reminded me why I don't exercise. running/walking indoors is just not interesting. I need to get out more.

Happy Birthday Rupak.
