Opening more antitrust investigations is not really the answer.  Businesses need to see the value in moving to open standards.  Unfortunately, Microsoft and their supporters continue to see this as an "anti-Microsoft" thing, and its not.  Its a pro-open standards thing.  If Microsoft were to legitimately work with ODF to address their concerns about office formats, I'd be the first one cheering.  Instead they chose to attempt to create FUD, stack standards organizations with clueless resellers, and release press releases claiming to support 'standards'.  

What they really offer is simply an over-complicated, non-open format that its own products do not even implement fully and is only designed to keep users locked into its own applications.

Everytime I hear Microsoft talk about 'standards', I am reminded of Inigo Montoya's words: "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."
