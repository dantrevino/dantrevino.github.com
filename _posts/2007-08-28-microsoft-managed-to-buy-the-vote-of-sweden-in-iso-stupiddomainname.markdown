Typical Microsoft.

To summarize... 20 new companies sign up to join Sweeden's ISO working group....ON THE DAY OF THE ooxml VOTE....20 companies who've never argued the merits or listened to the complaints about the accuracy or implementation of ooxml as a standard.  20 microsoft partners who dont know shit about standards, but do know they want more business.  Go in and deliberately wreck the thoughtful deliberation of all of the members already in place.
