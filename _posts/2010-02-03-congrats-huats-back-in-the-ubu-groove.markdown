Due to work and a new baby I've been largely AFC (away from community) for the past 7 months or so.  I've been minimally involved in community events, bug triaging, qa testing, etc, but nothing significant to speak of.  Things are settling down now, and I can't wait to get back into the ring!  Some of my goals over the next few months: 5 events across Florida for the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalJam">Global Jam</a>, Pump Up Ubuntu-US, get more involved with server QA, and (finally) get started on becoming a <del>MOTU</del> Ubuntu Developer.

In more exciting developments, I want to send hearty congratulations to Christophe Sauthier (<a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/~christophe.sauthier">Huats</a>)!  A few days back he became the father of a gorgeous baby boy.Â  Wish you and your family all the best my friend!
