I didnt use to hate mono, butÂ every timeÂ Jo Shields talks i edge closer in that direction. Â Insulting people while chiding them for insulting people is inane. Â Hiding the insult behind sarcasmÂ isn'tÂ very creative or particularly intelligent.

I respect your contributions to Debian and Ubuntu. Â You're already making your case by contributing to a better user experience.Â Â How about you take your own advice and quit contributing to the noise?

And FWIW, there is already a quite popular Ubuntu-based distro that is mono free. Â Its called Kubuntu.
