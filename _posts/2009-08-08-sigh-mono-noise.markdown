I didnt use to hate mono, but every time Jo Shields talks i edge closer in that direction.  Insulting people while chiding them for insulting people is inane.  Hiding the insult behind sarcasm isn't very creative or particularly intelligent.

I respect your contributions to Debian and Ubuntu.  You're already making your case by contributing to a better user experience.  How about you take your own advice and quit contributing to the noise?

And FWIW, there is already a quite popular Ubuntu-based distro that is mono free.  Its called Kubuntu.
