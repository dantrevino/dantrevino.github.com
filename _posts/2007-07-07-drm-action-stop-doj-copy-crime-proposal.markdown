1. Allow government to prosecute citizens at the behest of Disney & RIAA, without requiring proof that actual copyright infringement exists.  That silly little "burden of proof".....just ignore it.
2. Allow the government to wiretap your phone, read your email, again, at the behest of RIAA, if you are _suspected_ of copyright infringement.
3. Increase the penalty for ripping an mp3 to be the equivalent of drug smuggling.
