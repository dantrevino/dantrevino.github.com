You know, I just have to say: DUH!

I'm just tired of hearing about all these vulnerabilities. And Microsoft is acting like they take this seriously. But they dont. They dont care about users.  Well, at least not to the extent that it might cost them a proprietary protocol or two.

They didn't listen to us years ago when they made these so-called "architectural" changes. Microsoft made a deal with the devil to make their browser the most popular. And they paid for it with YOUR computer security. YOUR files. YOUR wasted time and money fighting spam, pop-ups, ad-ware, malware.

What idiot integrates a wide-open APPLICATION so tightly and needlessly with the operating system? Oh, Microsoft, thats who. Oh, but we were given the wonderful opportunity to display HTML in our email client and our media player and our instant messaging client.

This is a colossal mistake. And we told you so. Outlook Express is dead. IE is dying. Your media player and IM are next. But thats not news, its already begun.

Hey, Microsoft, here is a little hint: If you want your OS to display HTML, embed an html rendering engine. Keep you're OLE/ActiveX to yourself.

And if you really care about customers/users, then provide an API so that other html engines can be plugged in instead. Of course, if we were able to plug <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/">gecko</a> or some other competing engine in, Microsoft would not be able to leverage that to drive their old technologies and proprietary protocols.

But hey, what do they care, its your computer and they already have your money.
