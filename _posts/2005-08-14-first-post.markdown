Initial re-introduction of my web site.  Currently using [http://www.softwaregarden.com/products/listgarden/ ListGarden] by  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bricklin Dan Bricklin] (and  [http://www.danbricklin.com here]).

Its simplicity is the best part of it.  And its really easy to use.  Still a lot of work to be done on my CSS.  The gallery and project pages are barely started.  And I still need to backport my older posts.  More to come.....
