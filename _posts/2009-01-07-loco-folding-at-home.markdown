title: LoCo Folding.... At Home

After recently reading Aaron Toponce's mention of contributing to distributed.net, I thought I'd throw down the gauntlet to other LoCo teams for something that we're doing here in Florida.

For a little while we've had a Folding At Home team with typically have between 3 and 8 concurrent contributors to the team.  I personally use Christer's origami app for setting up all the PCs and laptops around the house.

For those not familiar with Folding At Home (F@H), it is similar to distributed.net in that it is a distributed calculation effort.  It differs in that F@H is targeted at protein folding which can <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu">hopefully lead to a better understanding of diseases</a> such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

As it stands Ubuntu Florida is the <a href="http://kakaostats.com/index.php?col=3&amp;search=ubuntu">#2 "Ubuntu" team out there </a>.  So where are the other LoCo teams?
