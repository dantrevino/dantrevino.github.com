ok....right now its looking like my <a href="http://www.fisherav.com/FVD-C1.htm">new camera</a> goes. having something i can carry around is nice, but picture quality isnt near what it was with my <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/JSP/fuji/epartners/bin/re2-WebFPS602Z2P_1_1_1.pdf">fuji 602z</a>. maybe i just need to learn how to use it better. 

re-learning redhat (<a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">fc2</a>) these days. i love <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">gentoo</a>, but i play with my laptop too much and i'm growing weary of the constant rebuilds. i could build a BINHOST, but no time/desire for that. plus i move around too much. i cant have a BINHOST everywhere. the <a href="http://www.bytebot.net/talks/FC3-t2rawhide-whatsnew.pdf">features</a> in <a href="http://torrent.linux.duke.edu/FC3-test1-binary-i386.torrent">fedora core 3</a> are looking pretty sweet. <a href="http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/index.ptml">yum</a>'s lack of feedback is maddening, and its not nearly as nice as portage for tracking dependencies. but then gentoo seems to be suffering from a lack of developers. there just arent enough people to keep up with all the ebuilds, so some updates lag. for instance, gentoo is still stuck with gdesklets 0.26 while i'm running .30 under fc2. server side though, where everything is stable, and i dont want the cpu wasting eye-candy, gentoo rocks.
