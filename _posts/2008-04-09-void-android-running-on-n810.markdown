Wow, awesome news.  Android running on the Nokia Tablets.  I'm kinda curious about the performance, battery life, etc.  But the opportunity, in the future, to possibly run android is a huge plus.  Even if it doesn't turn out to be my preference, the openness of the system really continues to be a big factor in why I love this device.  The flexibility to use the device the way <em>I</em> want to is why I'll continue to spend my money on things like this and avoid anything from the device dictatorship known as Apple.
