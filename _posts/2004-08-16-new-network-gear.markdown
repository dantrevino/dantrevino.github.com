Got a sweet new Linksys Network Storage Link today. It uses samba to share external USB 2.0 disks over your network. I had some initial issues having it read my Acomdata RocketPod, but a quick download of the newest firmware, and I was on my way.

Now, how does it work streaming video???...we'll see.
