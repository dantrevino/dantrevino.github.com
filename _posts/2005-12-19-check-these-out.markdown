check these out:

Amarok (http://amarok.kde.org/)
Logitech V500 (http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2146,CONTENTID=95&#8230; )

I'm a pretty dedicated GNOME fan, but Amarok blows every GNOME music player away.  Rhythmbox and Banshee dont even come close.
The Logitech mouse is pure sweetness.  Great range.  Awesome touch sensitive scrolling.  Works great with Linux (I havent tried to configure side scrolling).
